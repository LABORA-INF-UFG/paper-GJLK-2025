## 📄 Overview

This work proposes a holistic and scalable resource allocation framework for **Virtual Reality Cloud Gaming (VR-CG)** systems operating over future **6G networks**. VR-CG is an emerging class of immersive, highly interactive applications that impose tight demands on network, computing, and transport resources. Meeting these demands requires intelligent coordination across the end-to-end system.

The paper introduces a **multi-stage optimization framework** that integrates wireless access, computing–network convergence, semantic communication principles, and transport routing into a unified design. The approach is grounded in 3GPP specifications and evaluated using large-scale scenarios and real data sources.
